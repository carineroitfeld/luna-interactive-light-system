# luna-interactive-light-system

A TouchDesigner-based interactive light system translating lunar cycle logic into spatial digital behaviour.

LUNA explores cyclical transformation through proximity-driven interaction, where the visual state evolves based on participant presence and temporal progression.


Rather than mimicking user input directly, LUNA responds to presence through gradual environmental shifts.

The system models:
	•	Cyclical phase transitions
	•	Light intensity modulation
	•	Spatial scaling logic
	•	Behavioural responsiveness to proximity

The work exists as both:
	•	Installation-scale screen work
	•	Adaptable LED-based light environment

  Software:
	•	TouchDesigner
	•	GLSL shaders (if used)
	•	CHOP-based proximity logic
	•	LFO-driven phase transitions

Core System Logic:
	•	Presence input (camera / simulated input)
	•	Proximity mapped to phase index
	•	Time-based interpolation between states
	•	Light intensity modulation curve
	•	Looping autonomous fallback state

  •	1920x1080 display minimum
	•	Camera input (optional)
	•	Darkened environment preferred
	•	GPU capable of real-time shader rendering
